90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: the name of the annotator (latin characters; please
    use consistently)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV removed editorial sections at start and end of each volume.
    vol. 34 was missing; PV added it from the Shia version.
    Vol. 103 is missing (also in Shia version).
    Some additional cleaning work is needed: some pages
    still contain the "bihar al-anwar j x" from the running header.
    PV started annotation of the majlads and main book
    chapters but did not finish. 
    See https://en.wikishia.net/view/Bihar_al-anwar_(book)
    (and PageV01P079) for an overview of the chapter titles
